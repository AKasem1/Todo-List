TODO:
 * Frontend UI:
   - Add a Input field to add new tasks
   - Add a button to add new tasks
   - Segment the todo list into 3 sections
     - Pending
     - Completed
   - Hovering over the task item should display the options
     to delete, mark as completed etc...
   - Can't add same item twice (So a set should be used)

 * Backend API:
   - Folder structure up to the backend developer
   - Add a new task
   - Mark a task as completed
